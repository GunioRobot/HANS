# Hardware Actions and Notifications System

**HANS** is a **Hardware Actions and Notifications System** that allows your plugable hardware to express itself. It's also a reimplementation of the old [Hermes](http://forja.guadalinex.org/plugins/mediawiki/index.php?group_id=18) project.

## About

In the past, there were no app o system that were supposed to notify to the user when a new device was being plugged. Neither there was any way the user could choose a action for a non-standard device (CD, DVD, usb-stick and so), such to install a specific software to use it, to launch a specific application, load a kernel module, etc.
That's is why Guadalinex project decide (back in the 2005) to create [Hermes](http://forja.guadalinex.org/plugins/mediawiki/index.php?group_id=18) a hardware notification system that let the user to choose come actions and decide what to do with some gadgets that weren't supported upstream.
